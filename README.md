# 🧠 Coding Challenges & Practice

Welcome to my coding journal — a space where I solve challenges, practice algorithms, and build small projects in Python. This repo is all about improving problem-solving skills, building consistency, and documenting my journey as a developer.

## Why I Created This Repo

I didn’t just want to learn coding in theory — I wanted to practice it daily and see my growth over time. This repo helps me:

1️⃣**Practice & Consistency:** Coding is like a muscle — it only grows with daily reps. This repo keeps me accountable.<br>
2️⃣**Problem-Solving Skills:** Tackling challenges (patterns, logic puzzles, mini projects) makes me better at breaking problems into steps and writing clean code.<br>
3️⃣**Career Growth:** As I focus on DevOps & Cloud, strong coding fundamentals give me an edge in automation, scripting, and technical interviews. This repo is proof of that journey.

## Repo Structure

Here’s how the repo is organized:

📒 Daily Logs → bite-sized problems I solve each day to stay consistent.

🔹 Pattern-Based Problems → exercises that sharpen logic, loops, and structured thinking.

🛠️ Mini Projects → small real-world applications that connect practice to practical use.

## My Approach

It’s not about perfection — it’s about progress. Each file, each problem solved, is a step forward. Over time, this repo will grow into a library of solutions that shows not just what I know, but what I do.

If you’re also learning, feel free to explore, try the challenges, and compare approaches. If you’re further along, feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
